                Minesweeper 3D is a variation of the classic Minesweeper game, which is played on a three-dimensional grid rather than the traditional two-dimensional one.
                <br>
                The objective of the game is to clear a minefield without detonating any of the hidden mines.
                <br>
                Players use numbers on the surface squares to deduce the location of mines in the underlying 3D grid.
                <br>
                The game is won by successfully identifying all of the mines without detonating any of them.
            </p>
            <div class="flex justify-center items-center pt-6 pb-6">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold" id="GameLogic">Game Logic</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                The game logic of Minesweeper 3D is similar to that of the classic version. The player is presented with a grid of squares, each of which may contain a mine or not. The player must use logic and deduction to determine which squares contain mines and which do not.
                <br>
                Similar to the 2D version, the player can click on a square to reveal its contents, which can be a number or a mine. If the square contains a number, it indicates how many mines are located in the adjacent squares. If the square contains a mine, the game is over.
                <br>
                The player can also mark squares as containing mines by right-clicking on them. This allows the player to keep track of which squares are suspected to contain mines.
                <br>
                The player wins by correctly identifying all of the mines without detonating any of them. The game is lost when the player detonates a mine.
                <br>
                The main difference is that in the 2D version the player must consider a 3x3 square centered in the cell with the number, while in the 3D version the player must consider a 3x3x3 cube centered in the cell with the number. The cube is empty inside therefore only the cells in the external layer must be considered.
                <br>
                The player can decide between 3 cube sizes: 3x3x3, 5x5x5 and 7x7x7. The number of mines is also customizable between 1 and 20.

            </div>
            <p>
                To simplify the WebGL code for loading and rendering meshes, some helper functions have been implemented. These functions are located in the
                <code>WebGL_helper_functions</code>
                folder.
                <br>
                These functions are divided in
                <code>MeshLoader.js</code>
                and
                <code>RenderEngine.js</code>, which are used to load and render meshes respectively.
                <br>
                MeshLoader is used to load meshes from .obj and .mtl files. The neeed for this arose from the need to load objects that utilizes different textures for each face. The main difference between the mesh loader provided for the course and the one implemented is that the one implemented splits the object in parts based on the material used for each face. This allows to load objects that use different textures for each face.
                <br>
                RenderEngine is used to render meshes loaded with MeshLoader. It also provides functions to enable transparency and handle picking of objects in a 3D canvas.

                The project is composed of 5 main files:

                        <code>CubeRepresentation</code>
                        handles the generation of the cube structure and random bomb placement. The cube is represented as a 1D array of cells instead of a 3D matrix for optimization reasons.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>Element.js</code>
                        basic element that can be rendered. Most of the drawn objects are classes that extend this class.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>Camera.js</code>
                        handles the camera movement and rotation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>Environment.js</code>
                        after the start of the game this is the main handler, here are defined most of the event listeners.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>main.js</code>
                        contains the main function and the initialization of the game.

            <p>
                This class handles the camera position and the various movement events.
                <br>
                The camera always looks at (0,0,0) and has the z axis as up.
                <br>
                I decided to have the camera move around the cube instead of having the cube rotate, this means that the camera moves in a sphere of radius
                <code>r</code>
                around the center of the cube (0,0,0). For this reason the camera is controlled using polar coordinates that are converted to cartesian coordinates after each movement. Note that the code for converting the mouse / touch input to camera movement and the conversion from polar to cartesian coordinates is not my own.
                <br>
                The camera can be moved using the mouse, the touch screen or the keyboard. The camera can be zoomed using the mouse wheel, the pinch gesture or the q-e keys on the keyboard.
                <br>
                Camera also implements a
                <code>getSharedUniforms</code>
                function that returns the uniforms that are shared between all the objects in the scene. These uniforms are the camera position, the projection matrix, the view matrix, and the light position.

                Here you can find an array of Elements that contain every object that needs to be rendered and a Map that maps the id to the relative object, this is very useful to identify which object has been clicked.

                Part of the WebGL helper functions repository, this class is responsible for object rendering and object click identification.
                <br>
                This class defines 2 main functions:
                <code>render</code>
                and
                <code>detectObject</code>.
                <br>
                <code>render</code>
                is called every frame and is responsible for rendering all the objects in the environment. It takes in input the camera uniforms, the WebGL program info, a list of Elements to render, and an optional pickerProgramInfo. If picking is enabled, for each frame a hidden canvas is rendered with each object having the id represented as color in the texture.
                <br>
                <code>detectObject</code>
                is called when the user clicks on the canvas and is responsible for identifying which object has been clicked. It takes in input the x and y coordinates of the click and it extracts the color of the pixel in the specialized canvas at the specified mouse coordinates.
				<br>
				This class also contains the shaders needed to render objects and for picking.

				As mentioned before, this project uses a WebGL helper functions repository that I created to simplify the use of WebGL.
				<br>
				This repository contains a set of functions created following a WebGLFundamentals guide that can be used to load shaders, load textures, load meshes, render objects, and detect click.
				<br>
				I decided to make this classes as generic as possible, in order to be able to use them in other projects (which is also the reason for a separate repository), this means that both MeshLoader and RenderEngine implements features not needed for this project (such as extra parameters in shaders or loading of unused keys in .mtl).
			</p>
			<div class="flex justify-center items-center pt-6 pb-6">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold" id="Picking">Picking</h3>
            </div>
			<p>
				3D object click detection (or picking) has been implemented following a WebGLFundamentals guide.
				<br>
				The Environment has 2 separate programs that works with two separate buffers but render to the same canvas.
				The first program is the standard program that renders the objects with the correct textures and colors, while the second renders object implementing a texture where the color is the id of the object.
				<br>
				This means that the object drawn on the canvas will have a visible texture and a texture where the color is the id of the object.
				Note that the id is split in 4 elements from 0 to 255 each in order to take advantage of the full color space.
				<br>
				When the user clicks on the canvas, the click coordinates are passed to the detectObject function in RenderEngine.js. This function extracts the color of the pixel in the specialized canvas at the specified mouse coordinates, converts the 4 channels to an int and return the value.
				If the value id different than 0, it means that the user has clicked on an object and the Environment calls the onClick function of the clicked object.

            </div>
			<p>
				Since MeshLoader allows to specify a separate .mtl path for each object, I have been able to make one single Cube .obj file and generate multiple .mtl files for each texture.
				When generating the CubeElements, I can decide which .mtl file to load based on the cube value.
				<br>
				For example, if the cube value is 0, I load the .mtl file with the texture for the 0 value, if the cube value is 1, I load the .mtl file with the texture for the 1 value, and so on.
				<br>
				Another ineresting aspect is that since the materials are inside the Element object, I can call a <code>LoadOBJAndMesh</code> on the same object and update the texture without changing oter object properties like center or rotation.

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold" id="TransparencyOrder">Transparency needs order</h3>
            </div>
			<p>
				A problem I encountered was that often transparent object hides the object behind them and render only the background.
				<br>
				This is due to the fact that WebGL evaluates objects in the same order they are drawn, so if an object is drawn after a transparent object, it will be hidden.
				<br>
				For this reason while generating the CubeElements I have to make sure that objects that can be transparents (cells with value 0) are rendered last.
